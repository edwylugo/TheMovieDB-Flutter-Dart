#Intl
This package provides internationalization and localization facilities, including message translation, plurals and genders, date/number formatting and parsing, and bidirectional text.
URL: https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/intl

#http
This package contains a set of high-level functions and classes that make it easy to consume HTTP resources. It's platform-independent, and can be used on both the command-line and the browser.
URL: https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/http

#share
A Flutter plugin to share content from your Flutter app via the platform's share dialog.
Wraps the ACTION_SEND Intent on Android and UIActivityViewController on iOS.
URL: https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/share

#transparent_image
A simple transparent image. Represented as a Uint8List, which was originally extracted from the Flutter codebase (was private in the test package). It's a silly, simple library, but I found I needed transparent images in a few projects and found this is the simplest way to represent it :)
URL: https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/transparent_image

#logging
By default, the logging package does not do anything useful with the log messages. You must configure the logging level and add a handler for the log messages.
URL: https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/logging

#cached_network_image
Widget now uses builders for the placeholder and error widget and uses sqflite for cache management. 
URL: https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/cached_network_image

#url_launcher
A Flutter plugin for launching a URL in the mobile platform. Supports iOS and Android.
URL: https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/url_launcher
